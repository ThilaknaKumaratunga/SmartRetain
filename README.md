## Addressing Customer Churn with Sagemaker Pipelines

Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by large organizations today. There are lots of problems associated with customer churn. One of the major ones is the impact on revenue. Every customer brings revenue to the company. When customers leave, revenues are directly impacted, and the company must spend heavily to acquire new customers as replacements. Studies show that retaining a customer is nearly five times cheaper than acquiring a new one, making churn prevention a priority for sustainable growth. Beyond financial loss, a high churn rate damages a company’s reputation and signals deeper issues with its products, services, or overall customer experience. Understanding why customers leave is therefore essential. By analyzing churn, organizations can uncover weaknesses in their offerings, design targeted retention strategies for at-risk customers, and optimize marketing efforts to attract new ones more effectively.

### ML Problem Framing

What if we could build a solution that not only predicts which customers are likely to leave but also explains why? This would empower businesses to take proactive action and address the underlying causes of churn.
- This is a binary classification problem. The objective is to predict where a customer is going to leave or stay.
- **Churn = 1** → Customer will leave.
- **Churn = 0** → Customer will stay.

To evaluate such a model, we use the confusion matrix and associated metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
